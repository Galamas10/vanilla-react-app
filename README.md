# Vanilla React App
A vanilla app in ReactJS with webpack, react router, babel and sass support.

The goal of this is to have a simply but undestandable skeleton of a ReactJS project. To create apps without using create-react-app package and it's infinite dependencies, just clone and start developing your application.

How to use:
----------
**npm install**

**npm run watch** - build to build/ folder and watch for future changes

**npm start** - serve a express http server

**npm run build** - for production build
